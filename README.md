# QOSF_tasks
Answering the task question asked by QOSF.
Using Variational Quantum Computing method to train a quantum model which can approximate a two qubits quantum state.
This quantum state has the same probability for states |01> and |10>.


Bonus part:
I found that it is relevant to the direction of CNOT I put between Ry layers. 
If I only use CNOT from q0 to q1, but not the other way around, or mixing then, then I can always obtain a |01>+|10>.
